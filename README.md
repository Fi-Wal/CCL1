## ðŸŽ¨ **Art â€“ Objects and Animations**
Every clickable object in the game is printed onto the canvas seperately, and thus exists as png.
Although there's no classic player character or enemies, background animations were included in two rooms.

## ðŸ¥€ **Reflection**

### What went well:

- **Puzzling Together my Code:** Since I could use only very little of the template we were provided, I had to find out how to implement a lot of functionalities by myself. Despite having to do a lot of googleing (and repeatedly asking ChatGPT for help), I usually figured out quickly how to adapt new code snippets to work with the rest of my code.
- **Design and Vibes:** From the beginning, I wanted to put a strong emphasis on the art style and the calm, fresh vibe of the game. I'm proud of how the art turned out, especially the third room (study).

### Challenges:

- **Canvas Issues:** I struggled a lot with the canvas. Since there's a lot of objects that have to be drawn onto the canvas, it was hard fitting the background image properly as well as aligning the items perfectly.
- **The Rooms Object:** I had to do a lot of testing and trial and error until I had a structure for the rooms, so that every room can be loaded when it's reentered while only showing items that haven't been picked up yet and showing objects with multiple sprites in their correct state.


### Lessons Learned:
- **Changes in Plans:** Be ambitious, but open to changing aspects of your game. While working on it, you might discover that there's ideas you can't implement.
- **Trust in the Game Loop:** I don't know why, but when I started, I thought I wouldn't need a game loop. As soon as I wanted to update objects to not be drawn onto the canvas anymore, I realised I *do* need one. And I needed it for other things too, later on. So, now I know: trust in the game loop. You'll (probably) need it.
